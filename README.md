# InjectionScratch

Experimental Swift Package which can be used by the [HotReloading](https://github.com/johnno1962/HotReloading)
project to implement dynamic code updates on on iOS and tvOS
devices (while they are being debugged). The binary framework 
it uses to "link" the loaded image is currently for evaluation 
only and is time limited to be inoperable after April 13th 2022
by which time a more sustainable licensing option should be 
available. For more information on the technique it uses, please see:
